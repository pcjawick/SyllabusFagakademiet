@article{FA-aflimmer,
	Abstract = {Heart rate control is an important part of atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment and the recommendation for the target rate has become lenient in the recent guideline. Since heart rhythm of AF patients is irregularly irregular with great rate variation, the number of effective ventricular contractions may be different within a given time period among patients with similar heart rates and it may further lead to different levels of cardiac output. Therefore, we propose that every AF patient has his (her) own optimal heart rate, or to say that, the target for rate control in each AF patient should be individualized. This optimal heart rate can be defined by pulse counting, echocardiography or cardiopulmonary exercise test. With this new target, patients will achieve higher cardiac output with better exercise tolerance and life quality, even an improved prognosis.},

@article{FA-athero,
	Abstract = {Propagation of the pressure wave along the arterial tree (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) is related to the intrinsic elasticity of the arterial wall. PWV is increased in stiffer arteries and, when measured over the aorta, is an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Given the predictive power of PWV, identifying strategies that prevent or reduce stiffening may be important in prevention of cardiovascular events. One view is that aortic stiffness occurs as a result of atherosclerosis along the aorta. However, there is little or no association between PWV and classical risk factors for atherosclerosis, other than age and blood pressure. Furthermore, PWV does not increase during early stages of atherosclerosis, as measured by intima-media thickness and non-calcified atheroma, but it does increase in the presence of aortic calcification that occurs within advanced atherosclerotic plaque. Age-related widening of pulse pressure is the major cause of age-related increase in prevalence of hypertension and has been attributed to arterial stiffening. This review summarizes the methods of measuring aortic stiffness in humans, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to aortic stiffness, including its association with atherosclerosis, and the haemodynamic consequences of increased aortic stiffness.},
