	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination is recommended for asthmatic patients in many countries as observational studies have shown that influenza infection can be associated with asthma exacerbations. However, influenza vaccination has the potential to cause wheezing and adversely affect pulmonary function. While an overview concluded that there was no clear benefit of influenza vaccination in patients with asthma, this conclusion was not based on a systematic search of the literature.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy and safety of influenza vaccination in children and adults with asthma.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reviewed reference lists of articles. The latest search was carried out in November 2012.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised trials of influenza vaccination in children (over two years of age) and adults with asthma. We excluded studies involving people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Inclusion criteria and assessment of trial quality were applied by two review authors independently. Data extraction was done by two review authors independently. Study authors were contacted for missing information.
MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials were included in the first published version of this review, and nine further trials have been included in four updates. The included studies cover a wide diversity of people, settings and types of influenza vaccination, and we pooled data from the studies that employed similar vaccines. PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF INACTIVATED INFLUENZA VACCINE DURING THE INFLUENZA SEASON: A single parallel-group trial, involving 696 children, was able to assess the protective effects of influenza vaccination. There was no significant reduction in the number, duration or severity of influenza-related asthma exacerbations. There was no difference in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV) although children who had been vaccinated had better symptom scores during influenza-positive weeks. Two parallel-group trials in adults did not contribute data to these outcomes due to very low levels of confirmed influenza infection. ADVERSE EFFECTS OF INACTIVATED INFLUENZA VACCINE IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING VACCINATION: Two cross-over trials involving 1526 adults and 712 children (over three years old) with asthma compared inactivated trivalent split-virus influenza vaccine with a placebo injection. These trials excluded any clinically important increase in asthma exacerbations in the two weeks following influenza vaccination (risk difference 0.014; 95% confidence interval -0.010 to 0.037). However, there was significant heterogeneity between the findings of two trials involving 1104 adults in terms of asthma exacerbations in the first three days after vaccination with split-virus or surface-antigen inactivated vaccines. There was no significant difference in measures of healthcare utilisation, days off school/symptom-free days, mean lung function or medication usage.EFFECTS OF LIVE ATTENUATED (INTRANASAL) INFLUENZA VACCINATION: There were no significant differences found in exacerbations or measures of lung function following live attenuated cold recombinant vaccine versus placebo in two small studies on 17 adults and 48 children. There were no significant differences in asthma exacerbations found for the comparison live attenuated vaccine (intranasal) versus trivalent inactivated vaccine (intramuscular) in one study on 2229 children (over six years of age).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Uncertainty remains about the degree of protection that vaccination affords against asthma exacerbations that are related to influenza infection. Evidence from more recently published randomised trials of inactivated split-virus influenza vaccination indicates that there is no significant increase in asthma exacerbations immediately after vaccination in adults or children over three years of age. We were unable to address concerns regarding possible increased wheezing and hospital admissions in infants given live intranasal vaccination.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this systematic review is to establish the most effective stop smoking intervention approach for smokers with COPD. The search strategy included the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO, DARE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL, between January 2006 and January 2010. References of the included studies were also screened for additional papers, and further hand searches were conducted. The selection criteria included randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials with at least one subject group diagnosed with COPD. Two independent reviewers reviewed the included studies, using a quality assessment form developed from the selection criteria. Divergence of quality assessment scores was resolved by the 2 reviewers agreeing on a score. The 4 studies selected indicate that psychosocial interventions combined with pharmacotherapy are effective in smoking cessation at 12 months post-intervention, although the effect is not statistically significant, due to small sample size and heterogeneity between the studies (odds ratio 2.35, 95% CI 0.25-21.74,). However, despite this medium effect size, due to a lack of universal use of pharmacotherapies in most of the studies, it makes a definitive comparison of efficacy difficult to determine. This review also shows the effectiveness of psychosocial treatment for people with or without COPD symptoms at 12 months, although the effect of disease severity is not clear. This review also highlights the difficulty of maintaining attendance at community-based locations, compared to acute or research settings.},

@article{McIvor:2011aa,
	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease state characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases. Classically, it is thought to be a combination of emphysema and chronic bronchitis, although only one of these may be present in some people with COPD. The main risk factor for the development and deterioration of COPD is smoking.
METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of maintenance drug treatment in stable COPD? What are the effects of smoking cessation interventions in people with stable COPD? What are the effects of non-drug interventions in people with stable COPD? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
RESULTS: We found 119 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alpha(1) antitrypsin, antibiotics (prophylactic), anticholinergics (inhaled), beta(2) agonists (inhaled), corticosteroids (oral and inhaled), general physical activity enhancement, inspiratory muscle training, nutritional supplementation, mucolytics, oxygen treatment (long-term domiciliary treatment), peripheral muscle strength training, psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation, and theophylline.},

@article{FA-aflimmer,
	Abstract = {Heart rate control is an important part of atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment and the recommendation for the target rate has become lenient in the recent guideline. Since heart rhythm of AF patients is irregularly irregular with great rate variation, the number of effective ventricular contractions may be different within a given time period among patients with similar heart rates and it may further lead to different levels of cardiac output. Therefore, we propose that every AF patient has his (her) own optimal heart rate, or to say that, the target for rate control in each AF patient should be individualized. This optimal heart rate can be defined by pulse counting, echocardiography or cardiopulmonary exercise test. With this new target, patients will achieve higher cardiac output with better exercise tolerance and life quality, even an improved prognosis.},

@article{FA-athero,
	Abstract = {Propagation of the pressure wave along the arterial tree (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) is related to the intrinsic elasticity of the arterial wall. PWV is increased in stiffer arteries and, when measured over the aorta, is an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Given the predictive power of PWV, identifying strategies that prevent or reduce stiffening may be important in prevention of cardiovascular events. One view is that aortic stiffness occurs as a result of atherosclerosis along the aorta. However, there is little or no association between PWV and classical risk factors for atherosclerosis, other than age and blood pressure. Furthermore, PWV does not increase during early stages of atherosclerosis, as measured by intima-media thickness and non-calcified atheroma, but it does increase in the presence of aortic calcification that occurs within advanced atherosclerotic plaque. Age-related widening of pulse pressure is the major cause of age-related increase in prevalence of hypertension and has been attributed to arterial stiffening. This review summarizes the methods of measuring aortic stiffness in humans, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to aortic stiffness, including its association with atherosclerosis, and the haemodynamic consequences of increased aortic stiffness.},
